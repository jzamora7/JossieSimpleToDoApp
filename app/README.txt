## User Stories

Essentially this was my first time using the Android Studio and actually programming in Java.
Although I've done some app development in the past it was through XCode for iOS app development.
This was simple to follow along with enough insight to have a strong idea of what I was doing even though a lot of these functions were

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can **view a list of todo items**
* [X] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [X] User's **list of items persisted** upon modification and and retrieved properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [In Progress] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [In Progress] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

No initial challenges building this app, I do have a couple of questions that will come up during the bootcamp.
But at the start there isn't anything that could not be discovered by trial and error.
